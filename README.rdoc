= Brisbane

Brisbane generates a static photo gallery from Twitter hashtags. 
Very much a work-in-progress.

== Examples

* tcyasi[http://tcyasi.tatey.com/]
* vicfloods[http://vicfloods.tatey.com/]

== Getting Started

1. Install Brisbane at the command prompt if you haven't yet
    
     gem install brisbane
    
2. At the command prompt, create a new Brisbane template

     brisbane new caturday

    Where "caturday" is the hashtag

3. Change directory and fetch tweets tagged with +caturday+ that have photos

     cd caturday
     brisbane fetch caturday
     
4. Build the gallery from the sqlite database

     brisbane build
